**Wallpapers** are searched by `wal-script` at `~/Desktop/wallpapers/`

**WARNING :** some lines of the config - such as double screen stuff - have been commented out. Also some path have not been corrected : my system is not exactly organised the same way as this repo, sorry if some stuff do not have the right path, I will try my best to make it work ! Furthermore, I am pretty sure I am forgetting some stuff, and also the repo is not finished yet, so maybe come back in a while, when I eventually would have fixe everything !
